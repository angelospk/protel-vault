# Manager Spooler

The manager spooler functions similarly to the [[Report Spooler]], but it allows you to restrict access to certain reports based on user rights.

## Accessing the Manager Spooler:

Go to "Front Office" > "Office" > "Manager Spooler."

## Restricted Reports:

* Reports flagged as restricted in the system data can only be accessed by users with sufficient permissions.

## Benefits:

* Control access to sensitive financial or operational reports.
* Prevent unauthorized printing of confidential information.

## Tips:

* Define clear access rights for different user groups to ensure data security.
* Regularly review and update report restrictions as needed.
