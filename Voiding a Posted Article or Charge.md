# Voiding a Posted Article or Charge

This note explains how to cancel or reverse charges that have been posted to a guest's invoice.

## Using the Context Menu:

1. **Open the Invoice Dialog Box:** Access the [[Invoice Dialog Box]] for the relevant guest.
2. **Select the Posting:**  Click on the charge you want to void.
3. **Open Context Menu:** Right-click the selected posting.
4. **Choose "Void":**  Select "Process Marked Postings" > "Void" from the context menu.

## Manual Voiding:

1. **Post Charges:** Use the [[Post Charges]] function to enter a negative quantity or amount for the transaction account you want to void.

## Transferring to Unrequired Invoice:

* To avoid cluttering the guest's invoice with voided postings, consider transferring the negative postings to a separate, unrequired invoice. 

## Payment Method Voiding:

* Voiding a payment method retains both the positive and negative postings in the cash register.
* For "Accounts Receivable" or "Credit Card" payment methods, the counter-posting is also transferred to accounts receivable management.

## Important Considerations:

* Voiding a posting creates a negative counter-posting on the invoice, effectively canceling the original charge.
* Be cautious when voiding postings to ensure accurate accounting.

## Tips:

* Use the context menu for quick and easy voiding.
* Consider transferring reconciling postings to a separate invoice to maintain a clean guest invoice.
