# Private Reservation

A private reservation is made for an individual guest, not associated with a company, group, or travel agent.

## Creating a Private Reservation:

1. **Go to "Private Reservation":**  From the "Front Office" menu, select "Reservation" > "Private Reservation."
2. **Enter guest name:**  Type the guest's name in the "Search Profiles" dialog box and press Enter.
3. **Create a new profile (if needed):**  If the guest profile does not exist, click "New" and enter the guest details.
4. **Complete reservation details:**  In the [[Reservation Dialog Box]], enter the necessary information, such as arrival date, departure date, room type, and rate code.
5. **Confirm reservation:** Click "OK" to save the reservation.

## Room Plan and Room Type Plan:

You can also create private reservations directly in the [[Room Plan]] or [[Room Type Plan]]. When entering the reservation details in the [[Reservation Dialog Box]], simply leave the "Company," "Group," and "TA" fields blank.
