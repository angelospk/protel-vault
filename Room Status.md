# Room Status

The "Room Status" tab in the Housekeeping dialog box allows you to view and change room status for multiple rooms.

## Filtering Rooms:

* **Status Checkboxes:**  Select the room statuses you want to display (clean, dirty, out of service, etc.). 
* **All/None:** Quickly select or deselect all status checkboxes. 
* **Housek. Dept.:** Enter a specific housekeeping department. 
* **Guest Name:** Show the names of checked-in guests and the FO status (vacant/occupied). 
* **Search Room:**  Click to refresh the room list based on the selected criteria.

## Changing Room Status:

1. **Select Rooms:** Choose the rooms you want to update.
2. **Right-Click:**  Right-click the selection to open the context menu.
3. **Select New Status:**  Choose a new room status from the context menu options (cleaned, dirty, out of service, etc.).

## Vacant/Occupied Status:

* Housekeeping can also set rooms to "vacant" or "occupied" without affecting room availability. 
* Discrepancies between the system status and housekeeping status are highlighted in the "Discrepancy" tab.

## Tips:

* Use the "Room Status" tab to efficiently update room status for multiple rooms.
* Coordinate with housekeeping to ensure accurate and timely status changes.
* Review the "Discrepancy" tab to address any inconsistencies between system and housekeeping reports.
