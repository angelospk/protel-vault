# Batch Invoices (SQL only)

This function, available in SQL versions of protel Front Office, allows you to print information invoices for multiple guests in a single process.

## Accessing Batch Invoices:

Go to "Front Office" > "Cash Register" > "Batch Invoices."

## Filtering Reservations:

* Use the dropdown list to select the reservations to be included in the batch invoice:
    * All In-House Reservations
    * All Reservations for Today
    * All Departures for Today
    * All Departures from Yesterday
    * All Unsettled Accounts

## Marking Reservations:

* **Mark All:** Select all displayed reservations. 
* **Individual Selection:** Click individual reservations to include them in the batch invoice.

## Printing Invoices:

* **Print Invoices:**  Click to generate and print information invoices for the selected reservations.

## Posting Room Charges:

* **Post Room Charges:**  Posts room charges and fixed charges for today, creating an advanced invoice for each selected reservation.

## Important Considerations:

* The batch invoice only shows charges posted up to the current date. 
* Posting room charges through this function creates an advanced invoice, meaning those charges will not be posted again during the end-of-day routine.

## Tips:

* Use batch invoices to efficiently generate information invoices for a group of guests.
* The "Post Room Charges" function is useful for processing advanced payments for multiple guests.
