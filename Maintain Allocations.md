# Maintain Allocations

Allocations, also known as allotments, are contractually guaranteed blocks of rooms reserved for specific partners, such as tour operators or travel agents. 

## Types of Allocations:

## Allocation Availability:

* **Decrease Availability:**  Rooms are deducted from the overall availability, regardless of actual bookings.
* **Do Not Decrease Availability:**  Rooms are not immediately deducted, but reservations from the allocation reduce availability.
