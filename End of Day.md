# End of Day

The end-of-day routine in protel Front Office prepares the system for the next business day by posting charges, generating reports, updating statistics, and incrementing the system date.

## Accessing End of Day:

Go to "Front Office" > "Office" > "End of Day."

## End-of-Day Dialog Box:

* **Printer:**  Select the printer for end-of-day reports.
* **Report Section:** Choose the reports to be generated.
* **Fast EOD (without reorganization):**  Run a faster end-of-day routine without database reorganization (allowed for a limited number of consecutive days).
* **Execute Multiple EODs:**  Increment the system date by multiple days and run the end-of-day routine for each day.

## Running the End-of-Day Routine:

1. **Close Cash Registers:** Ensure all cash registers have been closed using [[Cash Register Closure]].
2. **Check In/Out Pending Guests:**  The system will prompt you to check in or check out any guests with pending arrivals or departures.
3. **Review Report Selection:**  Select or deselect reports as needed.
4. **Start Routine:** Click "OK" to initiate the end-of-day routine. 

## End-of-Day Activities:

* **Posting Charges:**  Accommodation charges, fixed charges, and other pending charges are posted to guest invoices.
* **Generating Statistics:**  Daily revenue and occupancy statistics are updated. 
* **Printing Reports:** Selected reports are printed.
* **Incrementing System Date:**  The system date is advanced by one day. 

## Important Considerations:

* The end-of-day routine cannot be run until all arrivals are checked in and all departures are checked out.
* The routine may take some time to complete, depending on the number of transactions and reports being generated. 
* Other workstations cannot access protel Front Office during the end-of-day routine.

## Tips:
