# Chance Sales

Chance sales allow you to create invoices for non-hotel guests, typically for purchases made at the hotel bar, restaurant, or other outlets.

## Creating a Passerby Invoice:

1. **Go to "Chance Sales":**  From the "Front Office" menu, select "Cash Register" > "Chance Sales."
2. **Select Invoice Recipient:** Choose "Passerby" or a specific guest profile (if applicable).
3. **Open Cash Register (if needed):**  Enter the cash register number and password.
4. **Post Charges:** In the [[Post Charges]] dialog box, enter the transaction accounts, quantities, and prices for the purchased items.
5. **Process Payment:** Select the payment method and amount in the "Post Payments" dialog box and click "OK" to print the invoice. 

## Editing a Passerby Invoice:

* **Departures List:**  Select "Include Departed Guests" and "Acct." in the [[Departures Report]] to view and edit passerby invoices until the end-of-day routine.
* **The Navigator:**  Right-click the chance sale entry to access the invoice.

## Important Considerations:

* Passerby invoices are assigned a regular invoice number and can be accessed in the [[Invoice History]].
* You cannot exit the passerby invoice until the full amount has been paid.

## Tips:

* Create a dedicated guest profile named "Passerby" to streamline the process.
* Ensure accurate charge entry and payment processing for chance sales.
* Train staff on how to create and manage passerby invoices.
