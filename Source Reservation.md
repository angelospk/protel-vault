# Source Reservation

A source reservation is linked to a source profile, which represents a reservation office or booking channel. This allows you to track revenue and occupancy based on the source of the reservation.

## Creating a Source Reservation:

1. **Go to "Source Reservation":** From the "Front Office" menu, select "Reservation" > "Source Reservation."
2. **Enter source name:** Type the name of the source (e.g., HRS, Booking.com) in the "Search Profiles" dialog box and press Enter.
3. **Create a new profile (if needed):** If the source profile does not exist, click "New" and enter the source details.
4. **Complete reservation details:**  In the [[Reservation Dialog Box]], enter the necessary information, ensuring the "Source" field is populated with the correct source profile.
5. **Confirm reservation:** Click "OK" to save the reservation.

## Invoice Address:

For source reservations, the system automatically opens a second invoice window (invoice "B") with the source address as the invoice recipient. You can manage invoice recipients and payment instructions in the [[Payment/Routing Instructions]] dialog box.

## Room Plan and Room Type Plan:

You can also create source reservations directly in the [[Room Plan]] or [[Room Type Plan]]. When entering the reservation details in the [[Reservation Dialog Box]], ensure the "Source" field is populated with the correct source profile.
