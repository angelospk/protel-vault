# No Shows Report

The No Shows Report displays a list of guests with confirmed arrivals who did not check in by the end-of-day routine. 

## Accessing the No Shows Report:

Go to "Front Office" > "Reports" > "No Shows."

## Report View:

* The report lists all guests with a "No Show" status.

## Actions:

* **Reactivate for Today:**  Changes the status to "Arrival" for the next day. 
* **Reactivate Today + CI:**  Changes the status to "Checked In" for the current day. 
* **Late Reservation + CI:**  Creates a walk-in reservation for the previous day, checks in the guest, and posts accommodation charges.
* **Late CI:**  Checks in a guest who arrived late and received a "No Show" status during the end-of-day routine. 
* **Print:** Generates a list of no-show reservations.

## Important Considerations:

* A "No Show" status is automatically assigned during the [[End of Day]] routine. 
* Carefully review details when using the "Late Reservation + CI" or "Late CI" functions to avoid incorrect postings.

## Tips:

* Use the No Shows Report to identify guests who did not arrive as scheduled.
* Utilize the reactivation functions to manage late arrivals or guests who were mistakenly marked as no-shows. 
* Analyze no-show trends to identify patterns and potentially adjust overbooking practices.
