# Report Spooler

The report spooler temporarily stores reports generated during the end-of-day routine or cash register closure, allowing you to review and print them later.

## Accessing the Report Spooler:

## Report List:

* The spooler displays a list of cached reports.

## Actions:

* **Print Jobs:** Prints the selected report(s).
* **View Jobs:** Displays the selected report(s) on screen.
* **Delete Jobs:**  Removes the selected report(s) from the spooler. 

## Retention Period:

* Reports are stored in the spooler for a maximum of 30 days, after which they are automatically deleted.

## Benefits:
