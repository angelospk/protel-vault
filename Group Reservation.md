# Group Reservation

A group reservation allows you to manage multiple rooms booked under a single group name, typically for events, conferences, or tour groups.

## Creating a Group Reservation:

1. **Go to "Group Reservation":** From the "Front Office" menu, select "Reservation" > "Group Reservation."
2. **Enter group name:**  Type the group name in the "Search Profiles" dialog box and press Enter.
3. **Create a new profile (if needed):** If the group profile does not exist, click "New" and enter the group details.
4. **Enter initial reservation details:** In the [[Reservation Dialog Box]], enter basic information like arrival date, departure date, and room type. The "Qty" field represents the total number of rooms for the group.
5. **Confirm reservation:** Click "OK" to create the group master and individual group member reservations. 

## Group Master:

* A group master reservation, identified by the room type "GRP MST," is automatically created for each group. 
* The group master holds the collective invoice and allows you to manage the group reservation centrally.
* You can access the group master in the [[Room Plan]] or [[Reservations Report]].

## Adding Group Members:

* **From the Room Plan:** Drag additional reservations to the room plan and link them to the group name in the [[Reservation Dialog Box]].
* **From the Group Master:** Use the "Grp.members" button in the [[The Navigator]] to add existing reservations or create new ones. [[Adding Group Members]]

## Removing Group Members:

* **Voiding the Reservation:** Double-click the reservation in the room plan and select "Void."
* **Removing from Group:**  Delete the group name from the [[Reservation Dialog Box]] or use the "Remove from group" button in the group master Navigator. [[Removing Group Members]]

## Group Actions:

Changes made to the group master can be applied to:

* **Group Members and Master:**  All reservations in the group.
* **Group Members Only:**  Only individual guest reservations.
* **Group Master Only:**  Only the collective group account.
* **Member Selection:**  Specific group members selected from a list.

## Group Confirmation:

You can create a group confirmation letter by clicking the "Res. texts" button in the group master Navigator.

## Changing Arrival/Departure Dates:

Use the [[Double-click Menu]] in the room plan to change the arrival or departure date for the entire group or specific members.

## Changing Rates and Rate Codes:

Edit the rate or rate code in the group master [[The Navigator]] to apply changes to all group members.

## Group Cancellation:

Use the [[Double-click Menu]] in the room plan to cancel the entire group or individual members.

## Group Check-In and Check-Out:

Use the [[Double-click Menu]] in the room plan to check in or check out the entire group. For check-out, it's often easier to use the [[Departures Report]].

## Creating a Group Invoice:

Define [[Payment/Routing Instructions]] in the group master to direct charges to the collective invoice. You can transfer charges from group members to the master invoice at any time.

## Group Advance Invoice:

Use the "Advanced Invoice" function in the group master [[Invoice Dialog Box]] to post outstanding accommodation charges and fixed charges for the entire group. 

## Rooming List:

The "Rooming List" allows you to enter names for group members without creating individual profiles. This is useful for large groups where only names are needed.

## Tips for Managing Group Reservations:

* Use descriptive group names to easily identify different groups.
* Create clear [[Payment/Routing Instructions]] to ensure correct invoice distribution.
* Consider using a [[Rooming List]] for large groups.
* Utilize the group master to manage the reservation centrally.
* Communicate effectively with group leaders to ensure smooth check-in and check-out processes.
