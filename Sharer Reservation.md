# Sharer Reservation

A sharer reservation is for multiple guests sharing a room but requiring separate invoices. Each sharer can have different arrival and departure dates, rate codes, and rates.

## Creating a Sharer Reservation:

* **During Reservation Creation:** Click the "Sharer" button in the [[Reservation Dialog Box]].
* **In the Navigator:** Click the "Create sharer" button in the [[The Navigator]] for an existing reservation.

## Sharer Dialog Box:

* **Enter sharer names:**  Add the names of all guests sharing the room. You can search for existing profiles or create new ones.
* **Adjust reservation details:**  Modify the arrival/departure dates, rate code, rate, and number of guests for each sharer.
* **Assign responsible sharer (RI):**  Select the "RI" checkbox next to the sharer responsible for payment of any shared bookings (e.g., spa treatments).

## Room Plan Display:

* Shared reservations are indicated by a plus sign (+) and the number of sharers in the arrival/departure section.
* Hovering over a shared reservation displays a tooltip with details for each sharer.
* Right-clicking opens a list of sharers, allowing you to access their individual Navigators or [[Double-click Menu]].

## Summarizing Reservations as Shared Reservations:

* **Using the Double-Click Menu:** Double-click a reservation in the room plan, select "Move," check "Incl. occupied rooms (share mode)," and choose the target room.
* This combines the two reservations into a shared reservation.

## Benefits:

* Separate invoices for each guest.
* Individual rates and reservation details for each sharer.
* Simplified management of shared bookings.

## Considerations:

* Sharing is not available for reservations with room changes.
* Housekeeping reports reflect the number of sharer reservations, not individual guests.

## Tips:

* Use sharer reservations for colleagues sharing a room or groups with individual billing requirements.
* Ensure clear communication with sharers regarding payment responsibilities.
