# Overbooking

Overbooking allows you to accept more reservations than the actual number of available rooms, anticipating a certain percentage of cancellations or no-shows. 

## Setting Overbooking Thresholds:

1. **Go to "Overbooking":**  From the "Front Office" menu, select "Reservation" > "Overbooking."
2. **Enter a period:** Define the date range for the overbooking threshold.
3. **Select days of the week:**  Choose specific days of the week to apply the threshold.
4. **Select a room type:**  Choose a specific room type or "Hotel" for all room types. 
5. **Define the threshold:** Enter the maximum number of rooms that can be overbooked in the "Rooms" box.
6. **Set the threshold:**  Click "Set" to apply the overbooking threshold.

## Benefits:

* **Maximized Occupancy:**  Potentially increase occupancy by accepting more reservations, accounting for potential cancellations.
* **Revenue Optimization:**  Fill rooms that would otherwise remain vacant due to no-shows. 

## Risks:

* **Guest Displacement:**  Overbooking can lead to situations where guests arrive with confirmed reservations but no rooms are available.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Guest displacement can result in negative reviews and harm your hotel's reputation.

## Tips:

* Use overbooking cautiously and strategically. 
* Set conservative overbooking thresholds, considering historical cancellation and no-show rates.
* Develop procedures for handling guest displacement, including alternative accommodation options and compensation.
* Monitor occupancy closely and adjust overbooking thresholds as needed.
