# Hurdle Rates

Hurdle rates define the minimum room rate at which a room can be sold on a specific date. They are typically managed by external yield management systems and integrated with protel Front Office.

## Purpose:

* **Maximize Revenue:**  Prevent rooms from being sold below a certain price threshold, ensuring profitability.
* **Optimize Pricing Strategies:** Dynamically adjust hurdle rates based on demand, occupancy, and market conditions.

## Integration:

Hurdle rates are usually set and managed by external yield management systems, such as IDeaS or Duetto. protel Front Office interfaces with these systems to retrieve and enforce hurdle rates during reservation creation and sales processes.

## Accessing Hurdle Rates:

The "Hurdle Rates" menu item in protel Front Office is only visible if a yield management system is connected. 

## Functionality:

* protel retrieves hurdle rates from the connected yield management system.
* The system prevents reservations from being made at rates below the hurdle rate for the chosen dates. 

## Benefits:

* Automated rate control based on yield management strategies.
* Improved revenue management and profitability. 
* Enhanced pricing consistency across all distribution channels.

## Tips:

* Work closely with your yield management provider to define optimal hurdle rate strategies.
* Regularly monitor hurdle rates and adjust them as needed to reflect changing market conditions.
