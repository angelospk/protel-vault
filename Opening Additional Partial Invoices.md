# Opening Additional Partial Invoices

This note explains how to create additional partial invoices for a reservation if the existing six invoices (A-F) are insufficient.

## Creating a New Partial Invoice:

1. **Open the Invoice Dialog Box:**  Access the [[Invoice Dialog Box]] for the reservation. 
2. **Select Postings:** Select the postings you want to move to the new invoice.
3. **Drag to Green Arrow:** Drag the selected postings to one of the green arrow buttons (e.g., "To C," "To D," etc.).
4. **New Invoice Creation:**  protel will automatically create a new partial invoice if you drag postings to an arrow button that does not yet have an assigned invoice.

## Tips:

* You can create up to six partial invoices (A-F) for a reservation.
* Consider using pseudo accounts for additional invoices if needed.
* Ensure each partial invoice has a clear recipient and payment agreement.
