# Local Text Fields

Local text fields allow you to enter information in a second language that uses a different character set than the active system language.

## Data Type:

Local text fields are typically user-defined fields of the "Unicode" data type. Some windows may also have a specific field labeled "Text (local)."

## Using Local Text Fields:

1. **Locate the local text field:**  Find the "Text (local)" field or a user-defined field of the "Unicode" data type.
2. **Enter the text:** Type the information in the second language.

## Example:

If your system language is English and you want to enter a trace for a Chinese-speaking guest, you would use the "Text (local)" field to enter the trace in Chinese.

## Availability:

Local text fields are typically available for specific features, such as traces, notes, or guest requests. Contact the protel support team for more information on configuring and using local text fields.
