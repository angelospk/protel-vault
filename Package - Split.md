# Package/Split

Packages allow you to group multiple charges (transaction accounts) together under a single name. This note explains how to create, manage, and split packages.

## Creating Packages:

* **Rate Code Packages:** Automatically created when posting a rate code that includes multiple services (e.g., accommodation with breakfast).
* **Transaction Account Packages:** Created manually using the "Summarize to Package" option in the [[Context Menu in the Invoice Dialog Box]].

## Managing Packages:

1. **Open the Package/Split Dialog Box:** Right-click a package posting in the [[Invoice Dialog Box]] and select "Posting Details."
2. **Edit Package Name and Text:**  Modify the package name and additional text in the top pane.
3. **View Package Charges:**  The left pane lists the charges included in the package. 
4. **Edit Individual Charges:** Right-click a charge to access its posting details.

## Transferring Charges:

* **Transfer from Invoice:** Add selected charges from the invoice to the current package. 
* **Remove from Package:**  Move selected charges from the package back to the invoice as individual postings.

## Splitting Packages:

* **Proportionate Split:**  Click the [1/2], [1/3], [1/4], [1/5], or [1/6] buttons to split the package value into equal parts.
* **Amount Split:** Enter a specific amount in the input box and click "Split Amount" to split off a defined value.

## Voiding Packages:

* Click the "Void" button to cancel the entire package.

## Posting Details Within a Package:

* Right-click a charge within the package to open its posting details.
* You can split or void individual charges within a package, which will adjust the overall package amount.

## Benefits:

* Simplified invoicing for bundled services. 
* Flexibility in splitting packages and distributing charges. 

## Tips:

* Use packages to create special offers or combine frequently booked services.
* Carefully manage package charges and splitting to ensure accurate accounting.
