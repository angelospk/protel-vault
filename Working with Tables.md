# Working with Tables

Many protel Front Office functions display information in tables, such as guest lists, reservation details, and reports. This note explains how to work with tables, including sorting, filtering, and editing data. 

## Sorting by Columns:

* **Click the column header:**  Click the header of the column you want to sort by. This will sort the table in ascending order (A-Z, 1-100, etc.).
* **Click the column header again:** Click the same column header again to sort the table in descending order (Z-A, 100-1, etc.).
* **Sort indicator:**  A small arrow in the column header indicates the sort order (up arrow for ascending, down arrow for descending).

## Changing the Column Width:

* **Hover over the separator:** Move your mouse over the vertical separator between two column headers. The cursor will change to a double-pointed arrow.
* **Drag the separator:** Click and drag the separator left or right to adjust the column width.
* **Double-click the separator:** Double-click the separator to automatically adjust the width to fit the column content.
* **Context menu:** Right-click the table header and select "Autofit Columns" to automatically adjust all columns.

## Printing and Exporting:

* **Context menu:** Right-click the table header to access options for printing and exporting the table data.
* **Print:** Print the table in various sizes.
* **Export:**  Export the table data to Excel or HTML for further processing.

## Searching Table Content:

* **Context menu:** Right-click the table header and select "Search."
* **Enter search text:** Type the text you want to find in the "Text" box.
* **Select column:** Choose the column you want to search in.
* **Search options:**  Use the "Exact Match," "Case Sensitive Search," and "Mark Search Results" options to refine your search.
